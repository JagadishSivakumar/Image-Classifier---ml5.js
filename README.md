# Working of ML5.js
ML5.js is a pretrained image classifier that runs in browser
It is an opensourced classfier developer by ML Developers,  It works on the basis of **Supervised Learning** 
- The Data set needs an input as an image
- The data set contains **Input**, image in (png, jpg) and its **label** in a .csv file
